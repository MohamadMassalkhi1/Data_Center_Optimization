# Data Center Cooling Optimization

An AI-powered cooling optimization system using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to minimize energy costs and water consumption in data centers.

## Features
- Reinforcement learning with DQN
- Web interface built with Flask
- Optimizes cooling strategies for different GPU types (H100, A100, V100)
- Real-time temperature and water usage visualization

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

## Note
This is one of my first reinforcement learning projects, created for learning purposes.
